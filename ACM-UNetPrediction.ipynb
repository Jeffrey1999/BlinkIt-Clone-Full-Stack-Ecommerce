        "    *   **Overall network structure:** How does it build upon or modify the standard UNet architecture?\n",
        "    *   **Key components/modules:** Identify any novel modules or attention mechanisms (e.g., 'Attention Complementary Module' or 'ACM'). Understand their purpose and how they contribute to the model's performance.\n",
        "    *   **Loss function:** What loss functions are used? Are there any specialized losses for medical image segmentation?\n",
        "    *   **Expected input data format:** What are the dimensions, number of channels, and expected value ranges of the input images?\n",
        "    *   **Preprocessing steps:** Are there any specific normalization, resizing, or other preprocessing steps mentioned before feeding data into the model?\n",

        "    *   **Input Dimensions:** Confirm the expected image sizes (e.g., 256x256, 512x512) and number of channels (e.g., 1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB).\n",
        "    *   **Normalization:** How are pixel values scaled or normalized before being fed into the network?\n",
        "    *   **Augmentation Techniques:** What data augmentation strategies (e.g., rotation, flipping, elastic deformation) are applied during training?\n",
        "    *   **Data Organization:** How should your custom dataset be structured to be compatible with the repository's data loading mechanisms?\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Model Implementation:** Browse the files in the `models/` directory (or wherever the model definition resides) to understand:\n",
        "    *   **`acmunet.py` (or similar):** Examine the code to see how the ACM-UNet architecture, including the Attention Complementary Module, is implemented in code. This will reinforce your understanding from the paper.\n",
